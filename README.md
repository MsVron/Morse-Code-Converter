### Converting Morse Code to Text

To convert Morse code to text:

1. Input the Morse code using dots, dashes, and spaces. For example, to convert ".. .-.. --- ...- . -.-- --- ..-" to text (which represents "I LOVE YOU"), enter:

   .. .-.. --- ...- . -.-- --- ..-
   ```

### Converting Text to Morse Code
